            <p className='text-center text-3xl'>useState Hook</p>
            <p>In React, useState is a special function that lets you add state to functional components. It provides a way to declare and manage state variables directly within a function component. It should be noted that one use of useState() can only be used to declare one state variable. It was introduced in version 16.8.</p>

              <ul className='list-item'>
                <p className='font-bold'>Internal working of useState hook:</p>
                <li className='list-item'>creates a new cell in the functional componentâ€™s memory object.</li>
                <li>New state values are stored in this cell during renders.</li>
                <li>The stack pointer points to the latest cell after each render.</li>
                <li>Deliberate user refresh triggers stack dump and fresh allocation.</li>
                <li>The memory cell preserves state between renders, ensuring persistence.</li>

        <div>
            <p className='text-center text-3xl'>useEffect Hook</p>
            <p>The useEffect in ReactJS is used to handle the side effects such as fetching data and updating DOM. This hook runs on every render but there is also a way of using a dependency array using which we can control the effect of rendering</p>
